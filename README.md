## What is this?

POSIX process API on Windows 2000 and later. (Our primary _test_ targets at the moment are Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.)

Due to the nature of application containers, expect desktop (traditional) app model support only.

## Is it ready to use?

It's a work in progress. Stay tuned.

## But there is Cygwin/MSys/MinGW/you name itâ€¦

POSIX process API (or [user API](https://github.com/treeswift/libwusers), for that matter) implementation in MinGW is incomplete.

As for Cygwin et al, see the next chapter.

## Is it GPL/AGPL/LGPL/LBGTQIGPL?

We are committed to releasing our code into the public domain + under [effectively equivalent terms](LICENSE) in jurisdictions that don't recognize one.

## Why the name?

Because forks. (Yes, `fork()`s.)

## Is there a code of conduct?

Be kind. (Or, well, fork and then whatever.)
